        <h2 class="op">Muhammad Sufiyan, <span>(Founder & CEO)</span></h2>
        <p>
          From shaping stories through 3D animation to building platforms that shape careers —
          Muhammad Sufiyan is not your  conventional tech founder. With over 12 years of experience
          in the animation and creative industry, he made a bold pivot into the world of software
          engineering in 2021, driven by an unshakable curiosity and passion for innovation.
        </p>
        <p>
          Today, as the Founder & CEO of HiringMine, he blends his creative roots with technical mastery
          to reimagine how hiring works in the modern world. With expertise in the MERN stack and a
          product mindset, he leads with a vision: to make talent discovery smarter, inclusive, and truly global.
        </p>
        <p>
          Under his leadership, HiringMine isn’t just another recruitment platform — it’s a mission to
          empower individuals, help recruiters hire better, and bring opportunity to those often overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
          Built with <span class="heart">♥</span> in Pakistan, for the world — and led by someone who’s never
          been afraid to start again and build bigger.

        <div class="profile-description">
            <p>As the technical mind behind HiringMine, Jaffar is redefining how hiring works in emerging markets. With a sharp eye for scalable systems and a deep belief in tech-for-good, he’s building AI-powered solutions that reduce noise, cut hiring time, and bring real structure to the messy world of recruitment.</p>
            <p>But Jaffar’s journey didn’t begin with startups. It began in classrooms — first as a student, then as a mentor. Today, as a Lead Trainer at SMIT, he’s helped over 1,500 learners launch their careers in tech. His mission? Empower the next generation of developers to not just write code — but create impact.</p>
            <p>Whether it’s building tools that pull job data from visuals, or leading teams through complex backend architectures, Jaffar brings clarity, purpose, and speed to everything he touches. He doesn’t just solve problems — he solves them at scale.</p>
            <p>At HiringMine, he’s not chasing trends. He’s engineering the future of hiring.</p>
